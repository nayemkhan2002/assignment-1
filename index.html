    <p>
      The problem presented to us by Miss Violet Marsh made a rather pleasant
      change from our usual routine work. Poirot had received a brisk and
      businesslike note from the lady asking for an appointment, and he had
      replied, asking her to call upon him at eleven o&rsquo;clock the following
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arrived punctually&mdash;a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but
      neatly dressed, with an assured and businesslike manner&mdash;clearly, a
      young woman who meant to get on in the world. I am not a great admirer of
      the so-called New Woman myself, and in spite of her good looks, I was not
      particularly prepossessed in her favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My business is of a somewhat unusual nature, M. Poirot,&rdquo; she
      began, after she had accepted a chair. &ldquo;I had better begin at the
      beginning and tell you the whole story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;If you please, mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, sons of a small
      yeoman farmer in Devonshire. The farm was a poor one, and the eldest
      brother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well indeed,
      and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man. The
      younger brother, Roger, my father, had no leanings toward the agricultural
      life. He managed to educate himself a little, and obtained a post as a
      clerk in a small firm. He married slightly above him; my mother was the
      daughter of a poor artist. My father died when I was six years old. When I
      was fourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. My only living relation
      then was my Uncle Andrew, who had recently returned from Australia and
      bought a small place in his native county, Crabtree Manor. He was
      exceedingly kind to his brother&rsquo;s orphan child, took me to live with
      him, and treated me in every way as though I were his own daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crabtree Manor,&rdquo; she pursued, &ldquo;in spite of its name, is
      really only an old farmhouse. Farming was in my uncle&rsquo;s blood, and
      he was intensely interested in various modern farming experiments.
      Although kindness itself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply rooted
      ideas as to the upbringing of women. Himself a man of little or no
      education, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed little value
      on what he called &lsquo;book knowledge.&rsquo; He was especially opposed
      to the education of women. In his opinion, girls should learn practical
      housework and dairy work, be useful about the home, and have as little to
      do with book-learning as possible. He proposed to bring me up on these
      lines, to my bitter disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rebelled frankly. I knew that I possessed a good brain, and had
      absolutely no talent for domestic duties. My uncle and I had many bitter
      arguments on the subject, for though much attached to each other, we were
      both self-willed. I was lucky enough to win a scholarship, and up to a
      certain point was successful in getting my own way. The crisis arose when
      I resolved to go to Girton. I had a little money of my own, left me by my
      mother, and I was quite determined to make the best use of the gifts God
      had given me. I had one long final argument with my uncle. He put the
      facts plainly before me. He had no other relations, and he had intended me
      to be his sole heiress. As I have told you, he was a very rich man. If I
      persisted in these &lsquo;newfangled notions&rsquo; of mine, however, I
      need look for nothing from him. I remained polite, but firm. I should
      always be deeply attached to him, but I must lead my own life. We parted
      on that note. &lsquo;You fancy your brains, my girl,&rsquo; were his last
      words. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no book-learning, but for all that, I&rsquo;ll
      pit mine against yours any day. We&rsquo;ll see what we shall see.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <div><br /></div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was nine years ago. I have stayed with him for a week-end
      occasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though his views
      remained unaltered. He never referred to my having matriculated, nor to my
      B. Sc. For the last three years his health has been failing, and a month
      ago he died. I am now coming to the point of my visit. My uncle left a
      most extraordinary will. By its terms, Crabtree Manor and its contents are
      to be at my disposal for a year from his death&mdash;&lsquo;during which
      time my clever niece may prove her wits,&rsquo; the actual words run. At
      the end of that period, &lsquo;my wits having proved better than
      hers,&rsquo; the house and all my uncle&rsquo;s large fortune pass to
      various charitable institutions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a little hard on you, mademoiselle,&rdquo; commented
      Poirot, &ldquo;seeing that you were Mr. Marsh&rsquo;s only blood
      relation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not look on it in that way. Uncle Andrew warned me fairly, and
      I chose my own path. Since I would not fall in with his wishes, he was at
      perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Was the will drawn up by a lawyer?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the man
      and his wife who lived in the house and looked after my uncle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;There might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I would not even attempt to do such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your
      uncle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;That is exactly how I look upon it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It bears that interpretation, certainly,&rdquo; said Poirot
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;Somewhere in this rambling old manor house your uncle
      has concealed either a sum of money in notes, or possibly a second will,
      and has given you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, M. Poirot, and I am paying you the compliment of assuming
      that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, eh! But that is very charming of you. My gray cells are at your
      disposal. You have made no search yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a cursory one, but I have too much respect for my
      uncle&rsquo;s undoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy
      one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Have you the will, or a copy of it with you?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
      Miss Marsh handed a document across the table. Poirot ran through it,
      nodding to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made three years ago. Dated March 25, and the time is given
      also&mdash;eleven a. m.&mdash;that is very suggestive. It narrows the
      field of search. Assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. A will
      made even half an hour later would upset this.&nbsp;<em>Eh bien</em>,
      mademoiselle, it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have
      presented to me here. I shall have all the pleasure in the world in
      solving it for you. Granted that your uncle was a man of ability, his gray
      cells cannot have been of the quality of Hercule Poirot&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>(Really, Poirot&rsquo;s vanity is blatant!)</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately, I have nothing of moment on hand at the minute.
      Hastings and I will go down to Crabtree Manor tonight. The man and wife
      who attended on your uncle are still there, I presume?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Yes, their name is Baker.&rdquo;</p>
    <div><br /></div>
    <p>
      The following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. We had arrived
      late the night before. Mr. and Mrs. Baker, having received a telegram from
      Miss Marsh, were expecting us. They were a pleasant couple, the man
      gnarled and pink-cheeked like a shriveled pippin, and his wife a woman of
      vast proportions and true Devonshire calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tired with our journey, including an eight-mile drive from the station, we
      had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken, apple pie and
      Devonshire cream. We had now disposed of an excellent breakfast, and were
      sitting in a small paneled room which had been the late Mr. Marsh&rsquo;s
      study and living-room. A roll-top desk stuffed with papers, all neatly
      docketed, stood against the wall, and a big leather armchair showed
      plainly that it had been its owner&rsquo;s constant resting-place. A big
      chintz-covered settee ran along the opposite wall, and the deep low
      window-seats were covered with the same faded chintz of an old-fashioned
      pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<em>Eh bien, mon ami</em>,&rdquo; said Poirot, lighting one of his
      tiny cigarettes, &ldquo;we must map out our plan of campaign. Already I
      have made a rough survey of the house, but I am of opinion that any due
      will be found in this room. We shall have to go through the documents in
      the desk with meticulous care. Naturally I do not expect to find the will
      among them, but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may
      conceal the clue to its hiding-place. But first we must have a little
      information. Ring the bell, I pray of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div><br /></div>
    <p>
      I did so. While we were waiting for it to be answered, Poirot walked up
      and down, looking about him approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man of method, this Mr. Marsh. See how neatly the packets of
      papers are docketed; and the key to each drawer has its ivory
      label&mdash;so has the key of the china-cabinet on the wall. And see with
      what precision the china within is arranged! It rejoices the heart.
      Nothing here offends the eye&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of the desk
      itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed. Poirot frowned at it, and
      withdrew it from the lock. On it were scrawled the words &ldquo;<em
        >Key of Roll-top Desk</em
      >&rdquo; in a crabbed handwriting quite unlike the neat superscriptures on
      the other keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An alien note,&rdquo; said Poirot, frowning. &ldquo;I could swear
      that here we have no longer the personality of Mr. Marsh. But who else has
      been in the house? Only Miss Marsh; and she, if I mistake not, is also a
      young lady of method and order.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>Baker came in answer to the bell.</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you fetch Madame your wife and answer a few questions?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Baker departed, and in a few moments returned with Mrs. Baker, wiping her
      hands on her apron and beaming all over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few clear words, Poirot set forth the object of his mission. The
      Bakers were immediately sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Us don&rsquo;t want to see Miss Violet done out of what&rsquo;s
      hers,&rdquo; declared the woman. &ldquo;Cruel hard, &rsquo;twould be, for
      hospitals to get it all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poirot proceeded with his questions. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker remembered
      perfectly witnessing the will. Baker had previously been sent into the
      neighboring town to get two printed will-forms.
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Two?&rdquo; said Poirot sharply.</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes sir, for safety like, I suppose, in case he should spoil
      one&mdash;and sure enough, so he did do. Us had signed one&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;What time of day was that?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Baker scratched his head, but his wife was quicker.</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to be sure, I&rsquo;d just put the milk on for the cocoa at
      eleven. Don&rsquo;t ee remember? It had all boiled over on the stove when
      us got back to kitchen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;And afterward?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Twould be about an hour later. Us had to go in again.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve made a mistake,&rsquo; says old Master,
      &lsquo;&mdash;had to tear the whole thing up. I&rsquo;ll trouble you to
      sign again.&rsquo; And us did. And afterward Master give us a tidy sum of
      money each. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve left you nothing in my will,&rsquo; says he,
      &lsquo;but each year I live, you&rsquo;ll have this to be a nest-egg when
      I&rsquo;m gone;&rsquo; and sure enough, so he did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>Poirot reflected.</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After you had signed the second time, what did Mr. Marsh do? Do you
      know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Went out to the village to pay tradesmen&rsquo;s books.&rdquo;</p>
    <div><br /></div>
    <p>
      That did not seem very promising. Poirot tried another tack. He held out
      the key of the desk.
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Is that your master&rsquo;s writing?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
      I may have imagined it, but I fancied that a moment or two elapsed before
      Baker replied: &ldquo;Yes sir, it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your master let the house? Have there been any strangers in it
      during the last three years?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;No sir.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;No visitors?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Only Miss Violet.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;No strangers of any kind been inside this room?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;No sir.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You forget the workmen, Jim,&rdquo; his wife reminded him.</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Workmen?&rdquo; Poirot wheeled round on her. &ldquo;What
      workmen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen had been
      in the house to do certain repairs. She was quite vague as to what the
      repairs were. Her view seemed to be that the whole thing was a fad of her
      master&rsquo;s, and quite unnecessary. Part of the time the workmen had
      been in the study, but what they had done there she could not say, as her
      master had not let either of them into the room while the work was in
      progress. Unfortunately they could not remember the name of the firm
      employed, beyond the fact that it was a Plymouth one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We progress, Hastings,&rdquo; said Poirot, rubbing his hands, as
      the Bakers left the room. &ldquo;Clearly he made a second will, and then
      had workmen from Plymouth in to make a suitable hiding-place. Instead of
      wasting time, taking up the floor and tapping the walls, we will go to
      Plymouth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div><br /></div>
    <p>
      With a little trouble we were able to get the information we wanted. And
      after one or two essays, we found the firm employed by Mr. Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their employees had all been with them many years, and it was easy to find
      the two men who had worked under Mr. Marsh&rsquo;s orders. They remembered
      the job perfectly. Among various other minor jobs, they had taken up one
      of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace, made a cavity beneath, and
      so cut the brick that it was impossible to see the joint. By pressing on
      the second brick from the end, the whole thing was raised. It had been
      quite a complicated piece of work, and the old gentleman had been very
      fussy about it. Our informant was a man called Coghan, a big, gaunt man
      with a grizzled mustache. He seemed an intelligent fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned to Crabtree Manor in high spirits, and locking the study door,
      proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect. It was
      impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when we pressed in the
      manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once disclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eagerly Poirot plunged in his hand. Suddenly his face fell from complacent
      elation to consternation. All he held was a charred fragment of stiff
      paper. But for it, the cavity was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<em>Sacr&eacute;</em>,&rdquo; cried Poirot angrily. &ldquo;Some one
      has been here before us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We examined the scrap of paper anxiously. Clearly it was a fragment of
      what we sought. A portion of Baker&rsquo;s signature remained, but no
      indication of what the terms of the will had been.
    </p>
    <p>Poirot sat back on his heels.</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand it not,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Who destroyed this?
      And what was their object?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;The Bakers?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<em>Pourquoi?</em> Neither will makes any provision for them, and
      they are more likely to be kept on with Miss Marsh than if the place
      became the property of a hospital. How could it be to anyone&rsquo;s
      advantage to destroy the will? The hospitals benefit, yes; but one cannot
      suspect institutions!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it
      himself,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>Poirot rose to his feet, dusting his knees with his usual care.</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;One of your more sensible
      observations, Hastings. Well, we can do no more here. We have done all
      that mortal man can do. We have successfully pitted our wits against the
      late Andrew Marsh, but unfortunately his niece is no better off for our
      success.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div><br /></div>
    <p>
      By driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a train to
      London, though not the principal express. Poirot was sad and dissatisfied.
      For my part, I was tired and dozed in a corner. Suddenly, as we were just
      moving out of Taunton, Poirot uttered a piercing squeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<em>Vite</em>, Hastings! Awake and jump. But jump, I say!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I knew where I was, we were standing on the platform, bareheaded
      and minus our valises, while the train disappeared into the night. I was
      furious, but Poirot paid no attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imbecile that I have been!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Triple imbecile!
      Not again will I vaunt my little gray cells!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good job, at any rate,&rdquo; I said grumpily.
      &ldquo;But what is this all about?&rdquo;

    <p>
      As usual, when following out his own ideas, he paid absolutely no
      attention to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tradesmen&rsquo;s books, I have left them entirely out of
      account! Yes, but where? Where? Never mind, I cannot be mistaken. We must
      return at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Easier said than done. We managed to get a slow train to Exeter, and there
      Poirot hired a car. We arrived back at Crabtree Manor in the small hours
      of the morning. I pass over the bewilderment of the Bakers when we had at
      last aroused them. Paying no attention to anybody, Poirot strode at once
      to the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been, not a triple imbecile, but thirty-six times one, my
      friend,&rdquo; he deigned to remark. &ldquo;Now, behold!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Going straight to the desk, he drew out the key, and detached the envelope
      from it. I stared at him stupidly. How could he possibly hope to find a
      big will-form in that tiny envelope? With great care he cut open the
      envelope, laying it out flat. Then he lighted the fire and held the plain
      inside surface of the envelope to the flame. In a few minutes faint
      characters began to appear.
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Poirot in triumph.</p>
    <p>
      I looked. There were just a few lines of faint writing stating briefly
      that he left everything to his niece Violet Marsh. It was dated March 25,
      twelve-thirty p. m., and witnessed by Albert Pike, confectioner, and
      Jessie Pike, married woman.
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;But is it legal?&rdquo; I gasped.</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I know, there is no law against writing your will in a
      blend of disappearing and sympathetic ink. The intention of the testator
      is clear, and the beneficiary is his only living relation. But the
      cleverness of him! He foresaw every step that a searcher would take, that
      I, miserable imbecile, took! He gets two will-forms, makes the servants
      sign twice, then sallies out with his will written on the inside of a
      dirty envelope, and a fountain pen containing his little ink-mixture. On
      some excuse he gets the confectioner and his wife to sign their names
      under his own signature; then he ties it to the key of his desk and
      chuckles to himself. If his niece sees through his little ruse, she will
      have justified her choice of life and elaborate education and be
      thoroughly welcome to his money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t see through it, did she?&rdquo; I said slowly.
      &ldquo;It seems rather unfair. The old man really won.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no, Hastings! It is&nbsp;<em>your</em> wits that go astray.
      Miss Marsh proved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher
      education for women by at once putting the matter in&nbsp;<em>my</em>
      hands. Always employ the expert! She has amply proved her right to the
      money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder&mdash;I very much wonder what old Andrew Marsh would have
      thought!

        Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
        law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so
        the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
        States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.
        Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this
        license, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg&trade;
        electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&trade; concept and
        trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be
        used if you charge for an eBook, except by following the terms of the
        trademark license, including paying royalties for use of the Project
        Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
        eBook, complying with the trademark license is very easy. You may use
        this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works,
        reports, performances and research. Project Gutenberg eBooks may be
        modified and printed and given away--you may do practically ANYTHING in
        the United States with eBooks not protected by U.S. copyright law.

        commercial redistribution.

        To protect the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting the free
        distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or
        any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
        Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

        Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
        Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
      </div>
      <div>
        1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
        electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
        and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
        (trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the
        terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all
        copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your possession.
        If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
        Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
        terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
        entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
      </div>
      <div>
        1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may
        only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by
        people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a
        few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
        works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
        paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
        Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
        agreement and help preserve free future access to Project
        Gutenberg&trade; electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
      </div>
      <div>
        1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
        Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the
        collection of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works. Nearly all the
        individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the
        United States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in
        the United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
        claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
        displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all
        references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you
        will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting free
        access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade;
        works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
        Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with the work. You can easily
        comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same
        format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&trade; License when you
        share it without charge with others.
      </div>
      <div>
        1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
        what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
        a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
        the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
        before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
        creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
        Gutenberg&trade; work. The Foundation makes no representations
        concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than
        the United States.

        with which the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is
        accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

      <div>
        1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is
        derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not contain

        holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the United
        States without paying any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or
        providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
        Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must

        distribution must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and
        any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
        will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&trade; License for all works
        posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
        beginning of this work.
      </div>

      <div>
        1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
        compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
        word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or
        distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work in a format other
        than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the
        official version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&trade; website

      <div>

        <div>
          &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive
          from the use of Project Gutenberg&trade; works calculated using the
          method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is
          owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark, but he
          has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
          Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
          within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
          legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
          payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

      <div>1.F.</div>
      <div>
        1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
        effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
        works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
        Gutenberg&trade; collection. Despite these efforts, Project
        Gutenberg&trade; electronic works, and the medium on which they may be
        stored, may contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to,
        incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a
        copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or
        damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that
        damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

      <div>
        1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the

        a Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work under this agreement,
        disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
        legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
        LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
        PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
        TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
        INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGE.

      <div>
        1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect
        in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive
        a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written
        explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received
        the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your
        written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the
        defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
        refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
        providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
        receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
        is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
        opportunities to fix the problem.

      <div>
        1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
        warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
        If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
        law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
        interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
        the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
        provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
      </div>
      <div>
        1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
        trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
        providing copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in
        accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
        production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade;
        electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
        including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
        following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or
        any Project Gutenberg&trade; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
        additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&trade; work, and (c) any
        Defect you cause.

        Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
      </div>
      <div>
        Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
        electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
        including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
        because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
        people in all walks of life.
      </div>
      <div>
        Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
        assistance they need are critical to reaching Project
        Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s goals and ensuring that the Project
        Gutenberg&trade; collection will remain freely available for generations
        to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was
        created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project
        Gutenberg&trade; and future generations. To learn more about the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
        can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

        Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
        Archive Foundation
      </div>
      <div>
        Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without
        widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
        increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
        freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
        array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
        ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
        status with the IRS.
      </div>
      <div>
        The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
        charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
        States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
        considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
        with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
        we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
        DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
        visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/"

        While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
        have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
        against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
        approach us with offers to donate.
      </div>
      <div>
        International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
        statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
        the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

        Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
        methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
        including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,

        works

      <div>
        Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
        Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
        freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed
        Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
        support.
      </div>
      <div>
        Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
        editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
        the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
        necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
